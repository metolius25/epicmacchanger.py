#Epic Mac Changer

##That's about it.

You can change the mac address of your device to a specified value. Try **python epicmacchanger.py -h** to see how it works. Works on Linux only. The change isn't persistent. The address will revert back to original after restarting your system. You can also use this as a troubleshooting method if your connection dies.
