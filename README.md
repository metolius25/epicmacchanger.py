<h2>Epic Mac Changer</h2>
<p>That's about it. You can change the mac address of your device to a specified value. try python epicmacchanger.py -h to see how it works. Works on Linux only. The change isn't persistent. The address will revert back to original after restarting your system. You can also use this as a troubleshooting method if your connection dies.</p>
