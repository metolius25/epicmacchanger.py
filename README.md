# Epic Mac Changer
## Just change your MAC...

Epic Mac Changer lets you change your MAC Address with a new one that you will specify. Nothing much other than saving you from a couple more terminal commands.

- epicmacchanger.py -i [eth0, wlan0 etc] -m [xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, Hexadecimal]

(Might kill off your connection. In that case a restart is needed and will revert back to your original MAC address in that case.)
